## 🚀 What is PasteClean?

**PasteClean** is a privacy-focused tool that automatically strips tracking parameters (like `?utm_source=`, `fbclid=`, `si=`) from URLs. It runs locally on your machine, ensuring your data never leaves your clipboard.

Stop sharing your browsing history with marketers. Clean your links before you share them.

- **📋 Auto-Clean Clipboard:** (Optional) Monitors your clipboard and cleans links instantly as you copy them.
- **⌨️ Global Hotkey:** Press a custom shortcut to clean the link currently in your clipboard from *any* app.
- **🌑 Dark Mode:** Sleek, modern interface that respects your system theme.
- **⚡ Lightning Fast:** Native performance powered by Electron and React.

## 💎 Pro Features
*Support independent development and unlock power-user tools:*

- **🔗 Link Unshortener:** Reveal the true destination of `bit.ly` or `t.co` links and strip their hidden trackers.
- **📦 Batch Mode:** Clean lists of URLs or entire paragraphs of text in milliseconds.
