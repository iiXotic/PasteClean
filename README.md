## What is PasteClean?

**PasteClean** is a privacy-focused tool that automatically strips tracking parameters (like `?utm_source=`, `fbclid=`, `si=`) from URLs. It runs locally on your machine, ensuring your data never leaves your clipboard.

Stop sharing your browsing history with marketers. Clean your links before you share them.

## Features

- **Privacy First:** Removes 50+ common tracking parameters automatically.
- **Auto-Clean Clipboard:** (Optional) Monitors your clipboard and cleans links instantly as you copy them.
- **Global Hotkey:** Press a custom shortcut to clean the link currently in your clipboard from *any* app.
- **Dark Mode:** Sleek, modern interface that respects your system theme.
- **Lightning Fast:** Native performance powered by Electron and React.

## Pro Features
*Support independent development and unlock power-user tools:*

- **Link Unshortener:** Reveal the true destination of `bit.ly` or `t.co` links and strip their hidden trackers.
- **Batch Mode:** Clean lists of URLs or entire paragraphs of text in milliseconds.
- **Privacy Stats:** Visualize how many trackers you've blocked and time saved.
